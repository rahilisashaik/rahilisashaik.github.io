Hello, my name is Rahil Shaik and this is my personal website! I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying chemical engineering and electrical engineering & computer science (EECS). I am interested in striking the intersection between computer science and clean tech. Particularly, using software engineering to enhance solutions in furthering sustainability.
