## TLDR
Hello 👋 my name is Rahil Shaik and this is my personal website! I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying chemical engineering and electrical engineering & computer science (EECS). I am interested in striking the intersection between computer science and medicine. 


## A Little Longer; Didn't Read
I grew up in Louisville, KY 🐎 attending DuPont Manual High School. I was interested in pursuing research in pharmaceuticals and medicine which led me to study chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. Since then, I have learned more about the power of computing, and pursued an additional degree in electrical engineering & computer science. Furthermore I directed my attention toward computational biology by pusruing research in computer vision for ensuring safe battery management systems (BMS), prediction of protein-ligand bonding, and battery materials algorithms in industry 🔋. It is now my goal to tackle medicine, particularly, using software engineering to enhance solutions in furthering medical research.

In my free time, I enjoy playing ping pong, basketball, NYT word games, lacrosse, PokemonGo, hiking, and spending time with my cat Buddy 🐱! this website is only a brief look into my life so feel free to reach out through my linked socials or email on the left. You can see what I'm working on through my github and more professional updates via my LinkedIn.
