Hi! My sister has been attending Jefferson County Public Schools for 9 years now and there was recently a decision by the school board to limit transportation in favor of students closer to the school. Though there was a lot of consideration for the students closer to the school, it has made getting my sister and a ton of others students to school really difficult. At home, it's been a big challenge trying to figure out the logistics of who will pick her up and drop her off. I think there should be some sort of reconsideration for the amount of buses and transportation that should be provided to students further from JCPS schools, if you agree and would like to support families that are also unhappy with this, please sign this petition! I also linked an article so you can get more information on the topic as well.
